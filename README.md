# Automatic Solar Tracker

Welcome to the repository of the **Automatic Solar Tracker**, a project aimed at maximizing the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems by maintaining optimal alignment between solar panels and the sun throughout the day. This innovative system combines analog control techniques and sustainable design principles, making it a cost-effective and eco-friendly solution for solar energy optimization.

## üåü Project Overview

Solar power is one of the most sustainable energy sources, especially in sun-rich regions. However, fixed solar panels often fail to capture maximum sunlight throughout the day due to the changing position of the sun. The **Automatic Solar Tracker** addresses this limitation by dynamically adjusting the orientation of solar panels using a single-axis tracking mechanism.

The system incorporates:

- **Light-dependent resistors (LDRs):** For detecting sunlight intensity.
- **PID controller:** Implemented using operational amplifiers for precise alignment.
- **Motor driver:** Ensures smooth panel movement.
- **Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM):** Controls the motor speed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

1. **Sunlight Sensing:** Measures light intensity using LDRs to detect the sun's position.
2. **PID Control:** Maintains precise alignment through Proportional-Integral-Derivative adjustments.
3. **Motor Control:** Adjusts panel orientation efficiently.
4. **Eco-Friendly Design:** The enclosure combines wood and 3D-printed PLA for sustainability and durability.
5. **Compact Design:** A two-layer PCB integrates all electronic components seamlessly.
